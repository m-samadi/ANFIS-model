This repository includes the ANFIS model used in the paper entitled "An Intelligent Approach for Autonomous Mobile Robots Path Planning Based on Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System" published by Elsevier on 15 May 2021.
<br/>
<br/>
## Elements
The repository includes two main elements: the data set and the ANFIS model. The data set is created in C++ codes and the ANFIS model is generated using the MATLAB ANFIS toolbox.
<br/>
<br/>
## Programming language and IDE
The programs are developed in Microsoft Visual Studio for creating the data set with C++ code and in MATLAB for generating the ANFIS model.
